# Data Science Capstone Project

## Purpose
The aim of this project was to use time-series machine learning methodologies in order to forecast exchange rates. Alternative models had been tested, however the model posted in this repository, a multivariate LSTM, is the one that yielded the best results.

## Data
Detailed explanations on the data used for this project can be found in the 'Data Preprocessing' folder. To mention briefly, this project used exchange rates in the form of USD against a foreign currency (e.g. USD against CAD) as the dependent variable. For explanatory variables, GDP growth rate, interest rate, terms of trade, and unemployment rate were considered. 

The final dataset for model analysis has been included in the repository so it can be reproduced by anyone.
