# Data Science Capstone Project

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to use time-series machine learning methodologies to forecast exchange rates. Alternative models had been tested, however the model posted in this repository is the one that yielded the best results, namely a multivariate LSTM model.  

## Data
A more detailed explanation on the data used for this project can be found in the 'Data Preprocessing' folder. To mention briefly, this project uses exchange rates in the form of USD against a foreign currency currency (e.g. USD against CAD) as the dependent variable. For explanatory variables, GDP growth rate, interest rate, terms of trade, and unemployment rate were considered. 

The final dataset for model analysis has been included in the repository so it can be reproduced by anyone.
