This section contains the files for deploying a Streamlit app for added interactivity with the graphs. 
(Don't forget to install <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> if it is not already on your computer!)

The main feature is the 'Best Model' tab, where our model is applied to a choice country from the drop-down menu. A slider for the starting date has been included, along with many other interactive Bokeh graph features.

The 'Beta' tab is an extension that is still in progress. The idea behind this feature is to see if a model trained on data from a certain country can accurately predict exchange rates for another country. For now, there are only two options for a trained model, but neither one gives good results at this point.

Other than making some adjustments to the folder 'path' location, the app can be run as is. 
(There is no need to go through the model training process as all the necessary files are included in the folder.)
